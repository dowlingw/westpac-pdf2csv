westpac-pdf2csv
===============

Converts PDF statements generated by Westpac into CSVs for import into financial software.

This script will parse PDFs in both the old (pre-August 2009) format through to the current format as at January 2017.

Following extraction, the script will use parsed summary data (total credits & debits) and validate the totals of transactions extracted.


Requirements
------------

This script is written in Perl and depends on the following CPAN modules:

-    `DateTime`
-    `File::Temp`
-    `Pod::Usage`
-    `Readonly`
-    `Text::CSV`

Usage
-----

Your source PDFs will need to be laid out in the following structure:

````
source_dir/
├── 000-000-00-0000     <- Folder per account, named as BSB/Acc#
│   ├── xxxx.pdf
└── 000-000-00-0001
    ├── xxxx.pdf        <- One or more PDFs with any name ending in .pdf
    └── yyyy.pdf
````

You then need to invoke the script with the path to the source destination and a writable output directory:


````
$ westpac-pdf2csv.pl -source SRC_DIR -output DST_DIR [-pdf2text PDF2TEXT_BIN]
````
